### Description 
We use four popular TV shows: ‘Game of thrones’, ‘Mr Robot’, ‘Smallville’ and ‘The walking dead’. From these shows, we collect 129 (3-12 seconds long) shots and first annotate all the heads
in each frame with bounding boxes, and then annotate each head pair as LAEO or not-LAEO.

# Download
Available soon.

### Evaluation protocol
